# RunPod Provider

The RunPod provider allows you to manage [RunPod](https://runpod.io) GPU cloud infrastructure using Terraform. RunPod provides on-demand GPU instances for machine learning, AI, and other compute-intensive workloads.

## Features

- **Pod Management**: Create and manage GPU and CPU pods with flexible configuration
- **Network Volumes**: Persistent storage volumes that can be attached to pods
- **Serverless Endpoints**: Deploy and manage serverless GPU endpoints
- **Data Sources**: Query existing resources including pods, volumes, endpoints, and templates

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    runpod = {
      source = "decentralized-infrastructure/runpod"
    }
  }
}

provider "runpod" {
  api_key = var.runpod_api_key
  # Or set via RUNPOD_API_KEY environment variable
}

# Create a network volume
resource "runpod_network_volume" "storage" {
  name           = "my-storage"
  size           = 10
  data_center_id = "US-CA-2"
}

# Create a GPU pod
resource "runpod_pod" "gpu_instance" {
  name              = "my-gpu-pod"
  image_name        = "runpod/pytorch:2.1.0-py3.10-cuda11.8.0-devel"
  gpu_type_ids      = ["NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090", "NVIDIA A40"]
  data_center_ids   = ["US-CA-2", "US-TX-3"]
  
  gpu_count            = 1
  cloud_type           = "COMMUNITY"
  support_public_ip    = true
  network_volume_id    = runpod_network_volume.storage.id
  
  volume_in_gb         = 20
  container_disk_in_gb = 20
  
  env = {
    MY_VAR = "value"
  }
  
  ports = ["8888/http", "22/tcp"]
}
```

## Authentication

The provider requires a RunPod API key for authentication. You can obtain an API key from the [RunPod Settings](https://www.runpod.io/console/user/settings) page.

There are two ways to configure authentication:

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)

```bash
export RUNPOD_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Option 2: Provider Configuration

```terraform
provider "runpod" {
  api_key = "your-api-key-here"  # Not recommended for production
}
```

## Important Notes

### Regional Constraints

- Network volumes must be in the same region as the pods they are attached to
- When attaching a network volume, restrict the pod's `data_center_ids` to regions where the volume exists

### GPU Availability

- GPU availability varies by region and type
- Specify multiple GPU types and regions to increase deployment success
- Community cloud instances are more cost-effective but may have limited availability

### Pod Updates

- Changing certain attributes (like `network_volume_id`) requires pod replacement
- Pods cannot be updated in-place via the RunPod API
- Plan carefully before applying changes that require replacement

### API Limitations

- The RunPod API does not return the actual deployed region in pod details
- Use the `actual_data_center` attribute (currently empty) as a placeholder for future API enhancements
